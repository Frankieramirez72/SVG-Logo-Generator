## Description

This project signifies the 10th module's culmination during the 10th week of the UCB Coding Bootcamp. Our main focus this week was delving into the intricacies of object-oriented programming. In this assignment, we encountered an interesting twist â€“ commencing with a blank slate. Equipped solely with a sample SVG file, our challenge was to construct a solution using Inquirer. This solution would artfully administer prompts within the terminal, enabling users to create their distinct SVG files according to their inputs.
